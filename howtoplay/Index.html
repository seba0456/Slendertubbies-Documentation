                <h1>How do I create a match in SlenderTubbies?</h1>
                <p>This document discusses all the steps of creating a match in SlenderTubbies.</p>
                <p>Firstly, in the main menu, you have to press the "Create" button. For now, we are going to skip networking
                    elements as I explain them later in the "Online Play" category.
                    By default, the created match will be Solo.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Game Modes</h3>
                        <p><img class="demoimage" src="Images/gamemode.png"></p>
                        <p>SlenderTubbies has 2 different game modes. Both game modes are available in Singleplayer and
                            Multiplayer.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <h4>Collect</h4>
                                <p>This is a classic horror game mode. The player must collect all the custards
                                    if they wish to win the game. The player takes the role of the victim, with the time
                                    to
                                    collect the custards being unlimited. If you are caught by a Slendertubby, you will
                                    lose.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h4>Versus</h4>
                                <p>This game mode is a bit more complicated. The host player takes on the role
                                    of the Slendertubby, their goal is to eliminate all
                                    survivors before they can collect all custards. All other players are survivors who
                                    must collect all the
                                    custards and not let the Slendertubby catch them. The Slendertubby will win when all
                                    players are caught. Survivors will win when all custards are collected.
                                    This is mainly a Multiplayer game mode that works best with real players. However,
                                    you can play it with bots by pressing 'M' in-game if needed.</p>

                        </ul>

                    <li>
                        <h3>Maps</h3>
                        <p><img class="demoimage" src="Images/maps.png"></p>
                        <p>SlenderTubbies has 10 different maps with an additional bonus map you can unlock. All of them
                            are available in Singleplayer and
                            Multiplayer, with each map name essentially describing what the specified map will
                            contain.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Woods</li>
                            <li>Woods (Legacy)</li>
                            <li>Maze</li>
                            <li>Lake</li>
                            <li>Bunker</li>
                            <li>Camp</li>
                            <li>Fortress</li>
                            <li>Wastelands</li>
                            <li>Warehouse</li>
                            <li>Riverside</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>My personal favorite maps are Bunker, Wastelands, Fortress and Maze.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Custard Amount</h3>
                        <p><img class="demoimage" src="Images/custards.png"></p>
                        <p>This is pretty self-explanatory. Using the slider, you can specify how many custards will
                            spawn.</p>
                        <p>The default amount of custards is 10.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Toggles</h3>
                        <p><img class="demoimage" src="Images/rules.png"></p>
                        <p>Toggles allow for the given match to include some unique elements. As you see, the game has
                            only 3 of them. They can
                            make the match harder or more unique depending on which toggles you enable.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <h4>Select Slendertubby</h4>
                                <p>Typically, all maps have a pre-determined Slendertubby. This toggle allows you to
                                    select which Slendertubby will spawn.
                                    In the Versus game mode, this toggle will allow the host to select which
                                    Slendertubby they will be.
                                    Maze has this option always enabled.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h4>Battery</h4>
                                <p>This toggle adds power consumption to your flashlight. When active, the player's
                                    flashlight loses power slowly. To keep your light from going out, you must
                                    collect batteries found around the chosen map.</p>
                                <p>This toggle functions in both Singleplayer and Multiplayer.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h4>Full Tubby Jacket</h4>
                                <p>This rule spawns every possible Slendertubby into the match. This toggle makes the
                                    game
                                    really challenging.</p>
                                <p>This toggle works only in the Collect game mode. This toggle works in both
                                    Singleplayer and Multiplayer.</p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Create</h3>
                        <p><img class="demoimage" src="Images/accept.png"></p>
                        <p>This button starts the game.</p>
