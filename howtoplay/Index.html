				<h1>How do I create a match in SlenderTubbies?</h1>
				<p>This document discusses all the steps of creating a match in SlenderTubbies.</p>
				<p>Firstly, in the main menu, you have to press "Create" button. For now, we are going to skip networking
					elements as I explain them later in the "Online Play" category.
					tab. By default, the created match will be Solo.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Game Modes<p><img class="demoimage" src="images/gamemode.png"></p>
						<p>SlenderTubbies has 2 different game modes. Both game modes are available in Singleplayer and
							Multiplayer.
						<ul>
							<li>Collect<p>This is a classic horror game mode. The player must collect all the custards
									if they wish to win the game. The player takes the role of the victim, with the time
									to
									collect the custards being unlimited. If you are caught by a Slendertubby, you will
									lose.</p>
							</li>
							<li>Versus<p>This game mode is a bit more complicated. The host player takes on the role
									of the Slendertubby, their goal is to eliminate all
									survivors before they can collect all custards. All other players are survivors who
									must collect all the
									custards and not let the Slendertubby catch them. The Slendertubby will win when all
									players are caught. Survivors will win when all custards are collected.
									This is mainly a Multiplayer game mode that works best with real players. However,
									you can play it with bots by pressing 'M' in-game if need-be.</p>
							</li>
						</ul>
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>Maps<p><img class="demoimage" src="images/maps.png"></p>
						<p>SlenderTubbies has 10 different maps with an additional bonus map you can unlock. All of them
							are available in Singleplayer and
							Multiplayer, with each map name essentially describing what the specified map will
							contain.
						<ul>
							<li>Woods</li>
							<li>Woods (Legacy)</li>
							<li>Maze</li>
							<li>Lake</li>
							<li>Bunker</li>
							<li>Camp</li>
							<li>Fortress</li>
							<li>Wastelands</li>
							<li>Warehouse</li>
							<li>Riverside</li>
						</ul>
						</p>
						<p>My personal favorite maps are Bunker, Wastelands, Fortress and Maze.</p>
					</li>
					<li>Custard Amount<p><img class="demoimage" src="images/custards.png"></p>
						<p>This is pretty self-explanatory. Using the slider, you can specify how many custards will
							spawn.</p>
						<p>The default amount of custards is 10.</p>
					</li>
					<li>Toggles<p><img class="demoimage" src="images/rules.png"></p>
						<p>Toggles allow for the given match to include some unique elements. As you see, the game has
							only 3 of them. They can
							make the match harder or more unique depending on which toggles you enable.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<p>Select Slendertubby</Select></p>
								<p>Typically, all maps have a pre-determined Slendertubby. This toggle allows you to
									select which Slendertubby will spawn.
									In the Versus game mode, this toggle will allow the host to select which
									Slendertubby they will be.
									Maze has this option <u>always</u> enabled.</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									</Battery>
								</p>
								<p>This toggle adds power consumption to your flashlight. When active, the player's
									flashlight loses power slowly. To keep your light from going out, you must
									collect batteries found around the chosen map.</p>
								<p>This toggle functions in both Singleplayer and Multiplayer.</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>Full Tubby Jacket</Select></p>
								<p>This rule spawns every possible Slendertubby into the match. This toggle makes the
									game
									really challenging.</p>
								<p>This toggle works only in the <u>Collect game mode</u> This toggle works in both
									Singleplayer and Multiplayer.</p>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Create<p><img class="demoimage" src="images/accept.png"></p>
						<p>This button starts the game.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
